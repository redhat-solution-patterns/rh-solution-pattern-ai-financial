== The story behind this solution pattern

This solution pattern uses a Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG) AI workflow to to summarize financial data
from a stock symbol API service. The use of AI in this scenario provides a financial analyst
with a starting point and is especially helpfull when comparing a number of different stock symbols at once.
Data returned from a stock symbol service is often terse including many acronyms and abreviations. The goal is to 
demonstrate how AI technologies can be used to summarize the financial data in a way that is 
more concise and meaningful in a short period of time with minimal human intervention.

The solution begins by using Red Hat Build of Apache Camel to ingest and syncronize publicly aviable financial data
into a vector database powered by Weaviate. The json formatted data returned from the stock symbol service conists of a company description followed by a number of 
financial metrics such as revenue, profit, market capitalization, etc.  

The RAG workflow consists of a vector database, an embeddings model (used to convert
words into vectors) and a large language model (LLM) to summarize the results which is presented to the user. 
This approach is desirable when information changes frequently or in semi-real time. 
For example, new stock prices are published every 15 minutes.
As an alternative to fine tuning an LLM to recognize your private knowledge, Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG) 
provides a reasonable approach to this solution with good accuracy.
