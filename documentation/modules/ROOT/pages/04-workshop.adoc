= Workshop
During this workshop youwill learn how to:

- Get experience with a Weaviate enterprise installation.
- Learn how to use the Weaviate Python client.
- Learn how python application are deployed on Openshift
- Work with the Gradio library to build a user interface.
- Work with an LLM server on Openshift
- Understand the various components that make up a RAG solution

== Installing the workshop environment
=== Before getting started

==== Prequisites

- An OpenShift Cluster
  * Version 4.16 or greater
  * A worker node with a minimum of 4 CPUs, 16 GB of memory and 
  a single NVIDIA T4 GPU with 16GB of memory. (AWS `g4dn.xlarge` or equivalent)
  * The https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/web_console/web_terminal/installing-web-terminal.html[web-terminal]
operator
- A client system with the following software installed:
  * https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/helm/latest[Helm]
  * https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven]
  * https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/[The Openshift `oc` cli]
- An https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key[AlphaVantage API Key] if you want to periodically 
refresh the stock symbol data.

=== Installing the environment

The following services on OpenShift are required:

==== Weaviate Vector Database

- `git clone https://github.com/redhat-na-ssa/demo-ai-weaviate`
- `cd demo-ai-weaviate`
- `oc apply -k deploy`

==== Ollama LLM Server

- `oc apply -k ollama/deploy`

Pull the necessary ML models:

Login to the Openshift console, open a terminal window in the `ollama` project
and run the following commands.

- `curl http://ollama.ollama/api/pull -d '{"model" : "all-minilm"}'`

- `curl http://ollama.ollama/api/pull -d '{"model" : "granite3-dense:8b"}'`

==== Stock Overview Ingestion Engine

===== Caching Proxy

Follow the instructions to install the caching proxy in the `camel` namespace.

- `oc new-project camel`
- `git clone https://github.com/joshdreagan/av-caching-proxy.git`
- `cd av-caching-proxy`
- `cp src/main/jkube/deployment.yml.template src/main/jkube/deployment.yml`
- `cp src/main/jkube/configmap.yml.template src/main/jkube/configmap.yml`
- `mvn -P openshift clean package oc:deploy`

The default values for `deployment.yml`, and `configmap.yml` should be fine. 

===== Stock Overview Syncronizer

Install the AlphaVantage syncronizer in the `camel` namespace. 

- `git clone https://github.com/joshdreagan/av-overview-sync.git`
- `cd av-overview-sync`
- `cp src/main/jkube/deployment.yml.template src/main/jkube/deployment.yml`
- `cp src/main/jkube/configmap.yml.template src/main/jkube/configmap.yml`
- `cp src/main/jkube/secret.yml.template src/main/jkube/secret.yml`
- `mvn -P openshift clean package oc:deploy`

Configure the `src/main/jkube/configmap.yml` to use the `all-minilm` vectorizer model 
and the `granite3-dense:8b` generative model.

Update your base64 encoded AlphaVantage API Key in the `src/main/jkube/secret.yml` file.

==== Gradio UI and application.

From a terminal, create an OpenShift application. 

[NOTE]
====
Obtain the 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-na-ssa/demo-ai-weaviate/refs/heads/main/deploy/weaviate/configmap.yaml[Weaviate API key]
and use it to create the RAG application.
====

- `oc new-app python~https://github.com/redhat-na-ssa/demo-ai-weaviate --name rag --context-dir=/src --env WEAVIATE_API_KEY=your_weaviate_admin-api-key`

Expose the app with an external route and have fun.

- `oc create route edge --service rag --insecure-policy=Redirect`

=== Running the workshop

- Review the https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=OVERVIEW&symbol=IBM&apikey=demo[IBM stock symbol json] to
explain the use case.
- Review the dataflow diagram to explain the workflow.
- Review the architecture diagram to explain the Openshift services.
- Run the `rag` application.
  * Try different search terms and see how the results change.
  * Vary the limits and see the different number of returned results.
  * Try different LLM prompts.
